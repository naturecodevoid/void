# void-sveltelib

A library with Svelte components and utilities that I use in most of my Svelte projects.

## Usage

This package is available as the `void-sveltelib` package on NPM; however, it has no changelog and probably won't comply with SemVer as it is only intended to be used in my projects. You can find the
library code in [src/lib](./src/lib). [src/routes](./src/routes) has a lot of usage examples for the various different components/utilities.

It will be used in [weather.naturecodevoid.dev](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/weather.naturecodevoid.dev) and [naturecodevoid.dev](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/naturecodevoid.dev); however, I
am still developing some parts of the library which these projects would need, so I haven't refactored those projects to use this library yet.

It currently requires sass, which requires svelte-preprocess.
