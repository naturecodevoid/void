# void

A library with Svelte components and utilities that I use in most of my Svelte projects.

## Usage

You can install the package to your project by pointing the dependency to the [build branch](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/void/tree/build).

You can find the library code in [src/lib](./src/lib). [src/routes](./src/routes) has a lot of usage examples for the various different components/utilities.

It will be used in [weather.naturecodevoid.dev](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/weather.naturecodevoid.dev) and [naturecodevoid.dev](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/naturecodevoid.dev); however, I
am still developing some parts of the library which these projects would need, so I haven't refactored those projects to use this library yet.
